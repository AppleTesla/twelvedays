## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
xmas <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/e584pryn8evm1gz/xmas.csv?dl=1")
xmas

xmas <- xmas %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    Full.Phrase = make_phrase(Day, Day.in.Words, Gift.Item, Verb, Adjective, Location)
  )

sing_day(xmas, 2, Full.Phrase)
```
